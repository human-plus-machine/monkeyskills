description: Phase 2 - UX Ideation + Prototype Spec. Maps PRT requirements to design system components, defines testable user journeys, and produces a framework-specific prototype specification ready for rapid prototyping.

# Phase 2: UX Ideation + Prototype Spec

## Purpose

Transform the approved PRT into a **testable UX prototype specification** by:
1. Mapping every functional requirement to specific design system components
2. Defining user journeys as step-by-step testable flows
3. Producing framework-specific component stubs wired to real design system components

This phase enables "fail fast" iteration — concept, test, and refine ideas **before** they enter the engineering backlog. The output should be actionable enough for a developer to build a working prototype in a single session using the design system.

## Output

A UX Ideation document saved to `.monkeyplan/{feature-name}/ux-ideation.md` containing:
- Component inventory (design system components mapped to requirements)
- Screen/view inventory with layout descriptions
- User journey flows (testable)
- Framework-specific prototype spec (based on `context.framework` in state.json)
- Optional Figma frame references
- Open questions for the design team

## Core Principles

### Design System First, Always

Every UI element in this spec must map to a component from the project's design system. If a requirement cannot be met with existing design system components, flag it explicitly:
```
[CUSTOM COMPONENT NEEDED]: {description of what's missing, flag for design team}
```

### Prototype Over Perfection

The goal is speed-to-feedback, not pixel-perfect design. A working prototype that uses real design system components and real data flows is worth more than a Figma mockup that hasn't been tested.

### Testable Journeys

Every user story from PRT Section 4 must produce at least one testable journey — a sequence of steps a user can walk through to validate the concept works as expected.

### Design-Engineering Continuity

This spec is the bridge between ideation and implementation. It must be specific enough that:
- A **designer** can validate component choices before pixel-perfect work begins
- A **developer** can scaffold the prototype without ambiguity
- A **PO/PM** can walk through the journey and confirm it solves the stated problem

## Phase 2 Process

### Step 0: Load Framework Preference

Read `context.framework` from state.json. This determines how Step 5 (Prototype Spec) is generated:

| `framework` | Step 5 Output |
|-------------|---------------|
| `angular` | Angular standalone component stubs, `.npmrc`, `angular.json` styles |
| `react` | React functional component stubs with hooks; design system class names and tokens |
| `vue` | Vue 3 Composition API SFC stubs; design system class names and tokens |
| `other` | Pseudo-code stubs showing component structure, data bindings, and event handlers |
| `framework-agnostic` | No code stubs; component inventory, screen inventory, user journeys, and TypeScript mock data interfaces only |

Steps 1-4 and Steps 6-7 are framework-agnostic and always produced.

### Step 1: Load PRT Context

Read `.monkeyplan/{feature-name}/prt.md`. Extract:
- All user stories from Section 4
- All functional requirements from Section 5
- All UI/UX requirements from Section 6
- Design System & Implementation notes from Section 8
- Non-functional requirements relevant to the prototype (performance, accessibility, browser support)

### Step 2: Build Component Inventory

For each functional requirement and UI/UX requirement in the PRT, identify the design system component(s) needed. Reference the project's design system catalog (from PRT Section 8).

Format as a table:

| Requirement | Design System Component | Selector / Name | Variant/Config | Notes |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| View invoice list | Data Table | [component name] | Sortable, filterable | Include status badge column |
| Approve/Reject action | Button | [component name] | Primary (Approve), Danger (Reject) | Triggers confirmation modal |
| Confirmation dialog | Modal | [component name] | Standard | Include warning icon |
| Status display | Badge/Chip | [component name] | Success/Warning/Danger variants | Map to invoice status values |
| Filter controls | Filter Bar | [component name] | Multi-select | Filter by status, date, vendor |
| Page navigation | Breadcrumb | [component name] | Standard | Show current location |
| Loading state | Spinner | [component name] | Inline | Show during API calls |

For any requirement where no design system component exists, add a row marked `[CUSTOM COMPONENT NEEDED]` with a description.

### Step 3: Define Screen/View Inventory

List every distinct screen or view the prototype needs. For each screen:

```markdown
### Screen: [Screen Name]

**Route:** `/[path]` (approximate)
**Entry point:** [how user arrives at this screen]
**Primary user story:** [Story N from PRT]

**Layout:**
- Header: [describe using design system layout components]
- Main content area: [describe primary content block]
- Sidebar/panel (if applicable): [describe]
- Footer/action bar: [describe]

**Design System Components used:**
- [component name]: [purpose]
- [component name]: [purpose]

**Key interactions on this screen:**
- [user action] → [system response]
- [user action] → [system response]

**Data requirements:**
- [field/entity needed to render this screen]
```

### Step 4: Define Testable User Journeys

For each user story from PRT Section 4, define a testable journey — a numbered sequence of steps a person can walk through:

```markdown
### Journey: [Story Title]

**User story:** As a [role], I want [goal] so that [benefit].
**Entry point:** [URL or screen name]
**Happy path:**

1. User navigates to [screen]
2. [Component] displays [data] — *validation: list loads with correct columns*
3. User [action] on [component] — *validation: [expected state change]*
4. [Component] responds with [state] — *validation: [expected UI feedback]*
5. User [action] to complete — *validation: [success state]*

**Edge cases to test:**
- [edge case]: expected behavior
- [edge case]: expected behavior

**Fail fast criteria:** If [condition], this approach does not solve the problem because [reason].
```

The "fail fast criteria" is key — this defines what would invalidate the concept so the team knows when to pivot.

### Step 5: Prototype Spec

Generate the prototype specification based on the `framework` preference from state.json.

---

#### If `framework` is `"angular"`

Produce Angular standalone component stubs. Reference the design system package from PRT Section 8 for module imports and style paths.

**Module Setup:**
```typescript
// app.component.ts (Standalone Angular 17+)
import { [DesignSystemModule] } from '[design-system-package]';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  imports: [[DesignSystemModule]]
})
```

**.npmrc:** Add any private registry entries required by the project's design system package.

**angular.json styles:** Include the design system stylesheet from PRT Section 8.

**Component Stubs — one per screen from Step 3:**
```typescript
// [feature-name]-[screen-name].component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { [DesignSystemModule] } from '[design-system-package]';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-[screen-name]',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [[DesignSystemModule]],
  template: `
    <div class="[layout-class]">
      <[breadcrumb-component] [items]="breadcrumbs"></[breadcrumb-component]>
      <h1>[Page Title]</h1>

      <[component-selector]
        [items]="[dataBinding]"
        (onAction)="handle[Action]($event)">
      </[component-selector]>
    </div>
  `
})
export class [ScreenName]Component implements OnInit {
  [dataBinding]: any[] = [];

  ngOnInit(): void {
    // Wire to [API endpoint from PRT Section 7]
  }

  handle[Action](event: any): void {
    // Implement [action description]
  }
}
```

---

#### If `framework` is `"react"`

Produce React functional component stubs with hooks.

**Project Setup:**
```bash
# Vite + React + TypeScript (recommended)
npm create vite@latest [feature-name]-prototype -- --template react-ts
```

**Design System Setup:** Add the project's design system package (from PRT Section 8) and any required stylesheet imports.

**Component Stubs — one per screen from Step 3:**
```tsx
// [ScreenName].tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import type { [EntityName] } from './types';

export function [ScreenName]() {
  const [data, setData] = useState<[EntityName][]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Wire to [API endpoint from PRT Section 7]
    setLoading(false);
  }, []);

  function handle[Action](item: [EntityName]) {
    // Implement [action description]
  }

  if (loading) return <div className="[spinner-class]" />;

  return (
    <div className="[layout-class]">
      <nav className="[breadcrumb-class]">{/* Breadcrumb items */}</nav>
      <h1>[Page Title]</h1>

      {/* [Component purpose] */}
      <div className="[table-class]">
        {/* Table structure using design system class names */}
      </div>

      {/* [Action buttons] */}
      <button className="[button-primary-class]"
        onClick={() => handle[Action](selectedItem)}>
        [Action Label]
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> **Note:** If the design system provides React component bindings, use those directly instead of CSS class names.

---

#### If `framework` is `"vue"`

Produce Vue 3 Composition API SFC stubs.

**Project Setup:**
```bash
# Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript
npm create vite@latest [feature-name]-prototype -- --template vue-ts
```

**Design System Setup:** Add the project's design system package (from PRT Section 8) and any required stylesheet imports.

**Component Stubs — one per screen from Step 3:**
```vue
<!-- [ScreenName].vue -->
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';
import type { [EntityName] } from './types';

const data = ref<[EntityName][]>([]);
const loading = ref(true);

onMounted(async () => {
  // Wire to [API endpoint from PRT Section 7]
  loading.value = false;
});

function handle[Action](item: [EntityName]) {
  // Implement [action description]
}
</script>

<template>
  <div class="[layout-class]">
    <nav class="[breadcrumb-class]"><!-- Breadcrumb items --></nav>
    <h1>[Page Title]</h1>

    <div v-if="loading" class="[spinner-class]" />

    <!-- [Component purpose] -->
    <div v-else class="[table-class]">
      <!-- Table structure using design system class names -->
    </div>

    <!-- [Action buttons] -->
    <button class="[button-primary-class]"
      @click="handle[Action](selectedItem)">
      [Action Label]
    </button>
  </div>
</template>
```

> **Note:** If the design system provides Vue component bindings or web components, use those directly. Otherwise, use design system CSS classes and tokens.

---

#### If `framework` is `"other"`

Ask the user for a brief description of their framework/setup, then produce **pseudo-code stubs** that are framework-neutral:

```
Screen: [Screen Name]
Route: /[path]

Component Structure:
  - PageLayout
    - Breadcrumb(items: [...])
    - Heading("[Page Title]")
    - DataTable(
        columns: [col1, col2, col3],
        data: bind(dataSource),
        sortable: true,
        onRowClick: handleRowSelect
      )
    - ButtonGroup
      - Button(label: "[Action]", variant: "primary", onClick: handle[Action])
      - Button(label: "[Action]", variant: "danger", onClick: handle[Action])

Data Bindings:
  - dataSource: [EntityName][] ← fetch from [API endpoint]
  - selectedItem: [EntityName] | null

Event Handlers:
  - handle[Action](item): [description of what happens]
  - handleRowSelect(item): [description]

Design System Mapping:
  - PageLayout → [design system layout component]
  - DataTable → [design system table component]
  - Button(primary) → [design system primary button]
  - Button(danger) → [design system danger button]
```

---

#### If `framework` is `"framework-agnostic"`

**Skip code stubs entirely.** The prototype spec section contains only:

1. A note: "Prototype spec is framework-agnostic. No code stubs generated. Use the component inventory (Section 1) and screen inventory (Section 2) to scaffold in your framework of choice."
2. Mock data TypeScript interfaces (see Mock Data Structure below)

This mode is useful when the PRT is handed off to a team that will choose their own scaffolding approach.

---

#### Mock Data Structure (All Frameworks)

Regardless of framework, always define TypeScript interfaces for primary data entities:

```typescript
// [feature-name].types.ts
export interface [EntityName] {
  id: string;
  // [field]: [type]; // [description from PRT]
}

// Mock data for prototype
export const MOCK_[ENTITY_NAME]S: [EntityName][] = [
  {
    id: '001',
    // [field]: [example value]
  }
];
```

### Step 6: Optional Figma References

If Figma frames exist or are planned, add a reference section:

```markdown
## Figma References

| Screen | Figma Frame ID | Status | Notes |
|--------|---------------|--------|-------|
| [Screen Name] | [frame-id or URL] | Planned / In Progress / Complete | |
```

If no Figma work exists yet, note: "Figma frames to be created after prototype validation. Reference the design system's Figma library for component specs."

### Step 7: Design Team Open Questions

Flag any decisions that need design team input before prototype development begins:

```markdown
## Open Questions for Design Team

| # | Question | Impact | Owner | Target Date |
|---|----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [Question about a component choice or custom component need] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Name/Team] | [Date] |
| 2 | [Question about interaction pattern] | | | |
```

## Quality Checklist for Phase 2

Before marking Phase 2 complete, verify:

### Completeness
- [ ] Every functional requirement from PRT Section 5 maps to a design system component (or a flagged custom need)
- [ ] Every user story from PRT Section 4 has a testable journey defined
- [ ] Every screen has a layout description and component list
- [ ] Prototype spec matches the `framework` preference from state.json
- [ ] Mock data types/interfaces defined for all primary entities

### Quality
- [ ] All component names are real design system components (not made up)
- [ ] Component variants/configs match what the design system supports
- [ ] "Fail fast criteria" defined for each journey
- [ ] No generic HTML elements used where the design system has an equivalent

### Handoff Readiness
- [ ] Could a developer scaffold a working prototype from this spec without asking questions?
- [ ] Could a PO/PM walk through the journeys and validate the concept?
- [ ] Could a designer identify what needs Figma work vs. what the design system handles?
